# art/peace Frontend

This directory contains the Reactjs frontend for `art/peace`, which provides a web interface for interacting with the `art/peace` application. The frontend will retrieve `art/peace` information from the backend and make posts / interactions through a wallet or the backend depending on if it is an onchain interaction or not.
